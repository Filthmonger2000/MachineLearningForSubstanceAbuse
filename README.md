# MachineLearningForSubstanceAbuse
Exploration of the predictive capacities of Machine Learning Algorithms for Substance abuse in the National Survey for Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) using R

## Dataset
The following link redirects to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive, where NSDUH data can be retrieved year by year or all since the first. R files are writen for 2019, the last complete dataset as of project analysis. Code may require editting for future NSDUH formats.
